<blockquote>&nbsp;

<em>Over the last 5 years the nature of software has fundamentally shifted into a state of continuous improvement and iteration. This provides designers with an amazing opportunity to turn this into a continuous conversation with your audience. Continuous conversation — small chunks of research done frequently and consistently — ensures the customer’s voice in our decision-making process. In fact, it ensures that research, as much as coding, designing or gathering requirements, takes its intended place in the iterative loop of product design and development.</em>

<h4>More than buzzwords</h4>
“User-centered design" and "data-driven” — as product managers, we know these buzzwords all too well. With good reason. They represent ideas that are at the heart and soul of good product management.

We may observe that "user-centered design” is lower on the ladder of abstraction than “data-driven.” A Google search of the the keyword “user-centered design” returns 239 million results, while “data-driven” returns 725 million results. And the conjoint “user-centered design and data-driven”? Nearly 80 million results. Setting aside this disparity in keyword search frequency, it's obvious that a lot of people have a lot to say about both of these subjects.

Yet, like all buzzwords, the terms “user-centered design” and “data-driven” find a way to nestle into conceptual abstraction. We may expound on a data-driven culture in one conversation, discuss the merits of user-centered design in another, before we return to grooming our product backlog in Jira. It's expedient and it's compartmentalized. Yet, these conversations run the risk of veering into intellectualization, which ironically runs counter to the very customer empathy needed of good user-centered design.

<h4>Considerations of silo creep</h4>
If one had to guess, data scientists, analysts, and business managers will gravitate toward discussions on data-centricity, whereas UI designers, UX researchers, and to a certain extent, product managers, will land more often into conversations centered on user-centered design. This is a broad generalization, of course. More often than not, however, the two conversations will take place independent of one another, with limited cross-pollination of key terms and ideas, at the expense of cross-disciplinary dialogue. Thus, even so-called Agile, cross-functional technology teams may not be immune to the silo mentality often ascribed to companies with more traditional hierarchical structures.

One possible explanation for silo creep in the context of product development teams may be the lack of a fully integrated and shared taxonomy and terminology between disciplines, such as data analytics and user experience design. To engage in a bit of methodological reductionism for a moment, consider that data scientists operate in a paradigmatically different place than user interface designers, who operate in a paradigmatically different place than marketing managers. In this extreme case, the emergence of a dysfunctional product team would seem inevitable. Another way to think about this is the sense in which multidisciplinarity, in the absence of interdisciplinary, will lead to teammates who talk past one another.

Another possibility is that product managers lack a systematic process by which to move fluidly from one phase of the product creation process to the other--from user interface design, to user experience research, to data analytics, to product development. If in fact the lack of a systematic process is to blame for the aforementioned ails, how might we integrate the different functions of product development together in a way that leads to a coherent, replicable, and harmonious product management process? That is the subject of Part II in this series.
